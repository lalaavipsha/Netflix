# Netflix
In this Repository I have built a Netflix clone! This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, I have used Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I built this app using React and used Styled Components for all the styling I implemented. One will need knowledge of React (useEffect, useState, useContext) and will need JavaScript knowledge for using higher order functions such as map, filter, reduce, and find. I have used Fuse.js for live search, and have test all our components using React Testing Library. I have used React router for navigation!
